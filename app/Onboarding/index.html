            <p>The Speak Up App is a feedback and user friendly app. It helps us to understand user interests and opinions. Continue to read below to find out information about the app features. </p>

      <div class="card-block" class="Ini">
          <h4 class="card-title">Initiatives</h4>

            <p>The Intiatives section of the app gives you free time to explore [the event] floor and visit different stalls. Each stall will be listed in the app along with a rating section and a button that allows you find out more bout the initative. </p>

<!-- How it all works: Speakers -->
      <div class="card-block" class="Sp">
          <h4 class="card-title">Speakers</h4>

            <p>At the [enter event name here], a range of speakers will be presenting different topics. To make your experience more informative, the Speakers section of Speak Up gives you a space to ask questions. Towards the end of the speaker's presentaion, questions that were asked by audience members will be displayed on the screen and answered by the speaker. </p>
      </div>
<!-- end of speakers explaination -->

<!-- How it all works: Pledges -->
      <div class="card-block" class="Pl">
          <h4 class="card-title">Pledges</h4>

            <p>Once you have visisted every Intiative stall and have heard the speakers, the Pledge page will ask you to enter a pledge title and then a desciption. Making a pledge is a way of reminding you of any commitments or promises you've made. Once you have made a pledge it will be automatically saved into our database and through the database we can contact you via email. </p>

            <p>Before you are able to experience the features, we will need you to register. This helps us keep in contact with you. Enjoy your experience. </p>
